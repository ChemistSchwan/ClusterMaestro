# ClusterMaestro

A python library created for the automated creation, handling and analysis of cluster materials.

This Software project was created for theoretical analysis of clustermaterials.

## Installation

The code is well organized and intended to be installed using pip. To do so, simply *cd source* and execute "pip install .". This should install the ClusterMaestro module and all dependencies correctly. Note, that Cython needs to be installed beforehand, as the setup process compiles some python files and that process needs Cython to be installed already.

## Documentation

We chose not to host the documentation on an external platform. However, the documentation was created as a web-page and is intended to be used in a browser. To do so, simply open one of the HTML-files within the *doc/build/html* folder and you are good to go.
