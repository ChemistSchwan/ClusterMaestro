# ClusterMaster

A python library created for the automated creation, handling and analysis of cluster materials. This software package was created within the FOR2824.

This Software project was created for theoretical analysis of clustermaterials within the FOR 2824     
research project in Giessen and Marburg (Germany), devision C1: Theoretical chemistry. The FOR 2824     
*Amorphous Molecular Materials with Extreme Non-Linear Optical Properties* deals with the synthesis,                 understanding and theoretical modeling of molecular cluster materials. The understanding of these                    materials on a molecular level and the precize modelling of structures of different length scales     
is a big part in the understanding of the optical properties. This python-module focuses on an easy     
on-the-fly creation of these materials as well as automation in handling various different aspects     
of theoretical analysis.    

## Installation

The code is well organized and intended to be installed using pip. To do so, simply *cd source* and execute "pip install .". This should install the ClusterMaster module and all dependencies correctly. Note, that Cython needs to be installed beforehand, as the setup process compiles some python files and that process needs Cython to be installed already.

## Documentation

We chose not to host the documentation on an external platform. However, the documentation was created as a web-page and is intended to be used in a browser. To do so, simply open one of the HTML-files within the *doc/build/html* folder and you are good to go.
