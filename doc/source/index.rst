Welcome to ClusterMaestro's documentation!
==========================================

ClusterMaestro is a library for the analysis of structures from quantum chemical computations. It is based on the
*atomic simulation environment* (ASE). Although ClusterMaestro can principally handel a lot of different
chemical systems, it is designed with the analysis of molecular clustermaterials in mind.
The simple user interface allows for a high degree of automation in everyday computing.
Its most powerfull aspect is the analysis of structures, particularly oligomers of similar molecules.
